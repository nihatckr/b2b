## 🎯 Project Overview

Implemented a comprehensive **automated task lifecycle management system** that:

- Automatically creates tasks based on business events (sample requests, approvals, orders)
- Connects customers and manufacturers through task workflows
- Provides real-time task management on both frontend and backend
- Ensures no step in the workflow is missed

---

## ✨ Major Features Implemented

### 1️⃣ **Backend Workflow Automation** ✅

- Task detail page with full context
- DataTable with filtering, sorting, statistics

### 3️⃣ **Sample Workflow** ✅

```
Customer Creates Sample Request
    ↓
SAMPLE_REQUEST task → Customer (Track sent requests)
SAMPLE_RESPONSE task → Manufacturer (Respond to requests)
    ↓
Manufacturer Reviews → Sample status changes
    ↓
INSPECTION → Auto create inspection task
PATTERN_READY → Auto create approval task for customer
    ↓
Customer Approves or Rejects
    ↓
If Approved: APPROVE_SAMPLE task

```

### 4️⃣ **Order Workflow** ✅

```
Customer Places Order
    ↓
PURCHASE_ORDER task → Customer (Track order)
QUOTATION task → Manufacturer (Provide estimate)
