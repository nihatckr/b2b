# ✅ SOLVED: React setState During Render Error

## Error Type

Console Error (React)

## Error Message

```
Cannot update a component (`AdminCategoriesPage`) while rendering a different component (`AdminCollectionsPage`).
```

## Root Cause

Multiple admin pages (AdminCollectionsPage, AdminCategoriesPage, AdminUsersPage) were using the same URQL queries (`ALL_COMPANIES_QUERY`) without proper request policies. When navigating between these pages, URQL's shared cache was causing state updates during render cycles.

## Solution

Added `requestPolicy: 'cache-and-network'` to all useQuery hooks in admin pages:

```typescript
// ✅ Fixed in all admin pages
const [result] = useQuery({
  query: ALL_COMPANIES_QUERY,
  requestPolicy: "cache-and-network", // ← Added
});
```

### Files Updated:

1. ✅ `admin/collections/page.tsx` - 3 queries fixed
2. ✅ `admin/categories/page.tsx` - 2 queries fixed
3. ✅ `admin/users/page.tsx` - 2 queries fixed
4. ✅ `admin/companies/page.tsx` - router.push moved to useEffect

## Result

✅ No more React rendering warnings
✅ Smooth navigation between admin pages
✅ Proper cache invalidation
